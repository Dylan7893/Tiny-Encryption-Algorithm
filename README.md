# Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) Implementation in C++

This C++ implementation of the **Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA)** provides a simple and fast symmetric key block cipher for encrypting and decrypting data securely. TEA uses a 128-bit key to encrypt data in 64-bit blocks, offering efficient encryption suitable for low-resource environments.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Simple and efficient **symmetric encryption** algorithm
- **128-bit key** size for encryption
- Easy-to-understand code with clear implementation of TEA cipher
- Encrypts and decrypts data in **64-bit blocks**

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Algorithm:** Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA)
